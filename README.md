For iOS, you can choose a simulated device or real Device, under [Platform] Simulators, from the run destination menu next to the scheme menu in the toolbar.


### Testing

Using the Test Navigator
When you hold the pointer over a bundle, class, or method name in the test navigator, a Run button appears. You can run one test, all the tests in a class, or all the tests in a bundle depending on where you hold the pointer in the test navigator list.

* To run all tests in a bundle, hold the pointer over the test bundle name and click the Run button that appears on the right.
